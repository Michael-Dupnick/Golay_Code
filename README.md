Golay_Code
==========

This program generates a random message in binary of length 12, and encodes the message into a code word using the Golay 24 code. It then ‘sends’ the code word over a simulated noisy channel that adds 0, 1, 2, or 3 errors to the encoded message. The received message is then decoded, all errors are corrected, and the original code word, as well as the message, is retrieved. This program also calculates its running time every time that it is run.
